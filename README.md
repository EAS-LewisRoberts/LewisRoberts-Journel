VM SETUP
The first topic i was tasked with was to create a branch, edit my journel and then push so that my peers can review and approve.
I then went onto the next activity which was an introduction to vm software. 
Firstly signing in to the easlab in order to start the process of using hosts and clusters.
I had to download then install windows and linux correctly. In order to install the software i had to download the correct ISO to software.
I did this by following a walk through presentation that was provided by Kaine.

COMPLICATIONS
Navigting my way through vSphere was a little challeging to begin with due to it being new to me.
Getting the actual server to run was the main hurdle, as it would not run to begin with and kept saying "error, try again". i overcame this problem by relasiing that i didnt connect it to power, which then run as well as it could.
The final probelem i ran into was the windows server not being able to finish its installation, due to it being the incorrect version, i selected windows home, whereas i shouldve selected windows pro. So tomorrow i plan to do the activity from the begining and select the correct version of windows.

To finish the day i made an entry in my journel to describe what tasks and activities i had completed and trailed.
